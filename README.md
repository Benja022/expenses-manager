# expenses-manager
Application to manage your income and expenses.
I did this project to learn React and Redux, and improve my skills in front-end development.
It has'nt been tested yet, so it may have some bugs.
Only tested on Chrome.
Actually it is not responsive, so it is not recommended to use it on mobile devices.

## Installation
Download the project and run the following commands:

´´´npm install
´´´npm start

## Usage
You can add your income and expenses, giving them a description and a value. It depends if it is an income or an expense, and its type (food, health, etc), appear one or another icons and color.
Also you can see a chart with stats of your income and expenses and select a month to see the stats of that month.
